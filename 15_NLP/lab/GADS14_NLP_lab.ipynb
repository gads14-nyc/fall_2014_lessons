Suppose we have a document with the word \u201csky\u201d appearing 200 times and another document with the word \u201csky\u201d appearing 50, the Euclidean distance between them will be higher but the angle will still be small because they are pointing to the same direction, which is what matters when we are comparing documents.\n",
